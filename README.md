## Site Summary

Dragons Delight is a small cafe and bakery business run in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. They are looking to build a sole online presence through the creation
of a new website where customers will be able to find everything that they need to engage with the business and order food. Their main target audience will continue to
be expats and tourists visiting the city- with a special focus on attracting guests from
The Pestana Riverside Hotel next door to them.
 

Please see more information about the strategy and scope [here](/docs/dragons-delight-strategy-and-scope.pdf) 

## Development Information  

This is my first big development project after making some amateur websites in the past based on lessons available 
at [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/). I have spent over a month working on this project and this is the third
repository I have made for it due to running into unresolved bug issues with the 
workspace of my last repository and not being happy with my first attempt at this project. Thankfully, I was able to re-use the code I've spent so long on for this version with
only some minor changes made based on the UX Survey you can find in the Testing Section below.

User Experience (UX)
===== 
  - First Time User Goals:

    - a. As a first time user, I want to access a menu to see what products are available should I choose to visit.
    - b. As a first time user, I want to be able to easily navigate through the site content and find what I'm looking
         for with ease.
    - c. As a first time user, I want to see pictures of the restaurant food to act as evidence of the standard and quality of food. 
    - d. As a first time user, I want to easily find contact methods such as social media, email or telephone links.


- As a Returning user:
    - a. As a returning visitor, I want to know how to make a reservation.
    - b. As a returning visitor, I want to check that the opening times have not changed.
    

- As a Frequent user:
   - a. As a frequent user, I want to know how I can keep up to date with all the latest
        Dragons Delight news. Is there a newsletter?
   - b. As a frequent user, I want to know about any loyalty schemes or special offers available to customers.  

   
 ## Design 

  - **Colour Scheme:**
        - The colour scheme for the website will be an offshade of white (#fafafa), a dark shade of grey (#323232) 
        and a light brown (#daa520) to bring in the idenity of the business and their colour scheme within the building.
  - **Typography:**
        - The font for the website will be "Noto Sans JP" and the logo and the food and drink menu heading font will be "Just Another Hand".

  - **Imagery:**
        - Imagery will be used frequently in the site to catch the users attention and entice them to sample
        some of the great products available. The page will consist of areas with Images as backgrounds,
        and there will also be a Image "Gallery" Section for users to look through. The Gallery will have 12 images,
        and a statement underneathe encouraging users to visit the company Instagram page to boost their presence there.  

## Wireframes

**The site will have one page with 3 sections within it.**
       
[The Mobile Wireframe](/docs/mobile-wireframe.pdf)

[Desktop/Laptop Wireframe](/docs/mobile-wireframe.pdf)

I decided that the culture of Mobile Users and Desktop users was extremely different. People using mobiles are often
on the move and have less time to scroll through mountains of content. They are also using touch screen devices which
makes scrolling more of a chore. With this in mind I decided to keep the mobile version much simpler with just the 
vitally important information they would need to make an order, or visit the cafe. Users with larger screens tend to 
have a more leisurely approach to visiting a site and obviously a much bigger screen to have more detailed content- 
so it makes sense to give these users a more indepth view of the company and extra encouragement to come along 
and try it for themselves.

## Features
  - Easy navigation through the site with a scroll to the top button, and fixed navigation on desktops.
  - Responsive on all devices, including the Samsung Galaxy Fold. Smaller than Bootstrap Breakpoints.
  - Social Media Links, with future further integration planned with Facebook Messenger.
  - Easy Order Now CTA on all devices.

### **UX Survey**
As part of my User Experience analysis I decided to run a survey with close family and friends, and the company
that the website will be for. During the testing phase I deployed the site to GitHub pages and made a survey with 
the following questions:  

- **1. What changes could be made to make the site look more appealing?**
    - One survey reply suggested to use snaps with customers in, however the company
    did not want to use this approach out of fear of not having consent to publish.
    - Another response suggested using better quality photos. This was a tough part of
    designing the site. Currently most of their content library is amateur photography.
    The company plans to get a photographer in for some proffesional photos, at this point
    all images on the website will be upgraded. Images have been set at 600x600 to try and make 
    them as responsive as possible.
    - Another User suggested changing the heading font on the sections to make the site more 
    readable. This action has been taken and now only has Noto Sans JP across the site accept 
    for the logo title.  

- **2. What could be improved with the functionality/navigation of the site?**
    - One Survey User suggested the button to the top didn't take the page right to the top
    of the page. This comment was immediately addressed and has now been fixed.
    - Other suggestions were noted for later releases when Javascript will be added.
- **3. What other functionalities do you think the site should have?** 
    - Most Users of the survey stated that nothing came to mind.
    - One User stated a Cake Ordering System, this is planned for a later release.
- **4. Do you have any suggestions for other improvements to the site?**
    - The majority of survey users had nothing to add.
- **5. How would you rate your overall experience with the website?**
    - All Users voted Good or Very Good.  

Some of the answers in the survey were deemed irrelevant because the Users had merely overlooked 
things rushing through the process of evaluation. All answers have been throughly investigated, 
the issues raised that haven't been addressed in this release will be scheduled for the next so
that Users feel a sense of evolution when returning to use the site.

Release Planning
====

**Initial Release**  

This is the current version of the website. Everything you see in the [linked repository](https://github.com/jakelashbrook/dragonsdelightcafe) 
is the first release of the Dragons Delight MVP website. There will be later releases planned as my coding knowledge 
expands so that the site can continue to grow and evolve to meet the users and companies needs. Time is also a factor 
in assesing later releases. Stages are yet to be decided, but you can see a list below of areas that will be addressed 
in future releases. This release has been under production by myself for over a month, I have purposely made a new 
repository for releasing this site so that developers can work back through clearer commits to easily find each stage 
of the site easily should Dragons Delight decide they wish another Developer to work on their site in the future. 


**Later Releases**  
- Multi Lingual options with flags of relevant languages to click on. The next logical step will be to make a Dutch 
version of the website. The reason English was decided on first was due to the culture of the business. Most of the 
clients are expats or tourists, and the business is ran using the English language. However, with ambitions to expand
into the community- I would like to make a Dutch version of all the content available. I will be working on this for
the next release. Other languages will also be considered at later stages.
- A "Bakery Store" where users can pre-order cakes for collection. There will be a 24 hour period before the cakes can
be picked up, and the owner is working on content and descriptions for this. This will come into force at a much later 
stage.
- A "Work For Us" area where users can apply for a job with their CV's.
- A "Staff Portal" where rotas, holiday requests, personnel details, and edits to the site can be made from.

Other Ideas may be added to this area at a later stage in conjunction with the business and user needs.  

**RELEASE NOTE:** *All of these releases will be made when more time is available and more software languages have been learnt to enact 
them.*

### **Code**
 - [Bootstrap 4.0.0](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/navbar/) Framework used throughout the website
